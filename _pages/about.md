That guy with the messy hair? That’s me.

I'm Leonardo Mangani, I'm 21 and I live in the countryside of Siena, in Italy. I’m currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Siena.

I'm passionate about computer science and math, and I enjoy learning how the technology we use every day works.

I live in Tuscany, and when I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me walking through the hills, getting a bit lost in nature.

My dream is to find a job that lets me have fun with my passion for scientific subjects while still having the freedom to travel, enjoy nature, and spend time with the people I care about.
