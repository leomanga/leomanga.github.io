Hello everyone, the Community Bonding period has concluded, and I want to share my progress with SymPy.

First of all, I'm trying to correctly implement a new algorithm for the calculation of inequalities to ensure the stability of a dynamic system.
Everything can be found here [#28021(Draft)](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/28021#issuecomment-2906873911).
There are some limitations of that algorithm and, thanks to the help of maintainers and mentors, I'm trying to find the best solution.

Apart from that, I started locally to rewrite the `TransferFunction` class, aiming to find the best way to expand the `physics.control.lti` methods. The goal is to maintain retrocompatibility and enhance code readability.
The way I'm exploring uses a superclass `TransferFunctionBase`, which should be inherited by `TransferFunction` and `DTTransferFunction` (Discrete-Time TransferFunction). That implementation is very useful because many methods are shared between these classes. However there are some problems with some functions which should return an instance of the class itself, that are forcing me to complicate the code with additional private functions.
