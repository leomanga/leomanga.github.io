Hello everyone.

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve been selected to participate in Google Summer of Code 2025 with my
[project proposal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/proposals/details/XGK5vFpL) for [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).

I’m incredibly grateful for this opportunity and confident it will help me grow both technically and personally thanks to the amazing SymPy community.

From now on, I’ll be sharing my thoughts and updates on my progress here on the blog.
